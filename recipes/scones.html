<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 200C (fan) and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.</li>
<li>Take a large mixing bowl and combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, xanthan gum and salt.</li>
<li>Cut the butter into small cubes and then add to the mixing bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mix with you hands, to produce a breadcrumb-like mixture.
<li>Optional: add the raisins to the mixture if you want to make fruity scones].</li>
<li>dd the eggs and milk to the mixture gradually, stirring to combine as you go. You will probably need to get your hands in there again to get a nice pliable dough. If it is sticky, add a bit more flour. If it is dry and breaking apart, add a drop more milk.</li>
<li>Dust a surface with flour and then press the dough out with you hands or a rolling pin, until it is around 3cm thick. Scones do not rise much when baked so cut them fairly thick, rather than creating little thin disks.</li>
<li>Cut into rounds using a 6-8cm cookie cutter (dust the cutter with a little flour before each press, to reduce the risk of sticking). You should end up with 10 scones.</li>
<li>Place the scones on the greaseproof paper, brush the tops a little beaten egg (from the extra glazing egg).</li>
<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, until risen and golden. Eat straightaway, or allow to cool and freeze for later use. Serve with jam and clotted cream for the full English gluten free afternoon tea experience.</li>
